\chapter{Scalable Graph Generation}
\label{chp: generation}

Compared to the tasks of link prediction and query answering we solve in order to perform knowledge graph reasoning, performing general graph generation involves the much more difficult task of discrete distribution learning. Graph generation models are not only posed with complex datasets with many diverse features per sample, for which an appropriate latent representation needs to be learned, but it is also a difficult scalability challenge to output new samples from the given distribution with the same fidelity. 

Nonetheless, the huge number of potential applications of a graph generation system motivates research into this difficult field. We can single out the recent popularity of \emph{drug discovery}, a new scientific field forming from the collaboration of biochemical research and applied graph machine learning, where graph generation models are used for outputting new molecular structures to synthesize as potential novel cures, designing novel proteins for specific functions, helping better understand inter-cellular or drug-to-drug interaction networks, and much more.

In this chapter, I will give a detailed presentation of three techniques for scalable graph sampling, before concluding with analyzing the potential of graph generation on the novel application of scalable knowledge graph anomaly correction.
