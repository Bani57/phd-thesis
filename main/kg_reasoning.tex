This chapter will cover our COINs technique for scalable knowledge graph reasoning, having both theoretical and experimental guarantees, as well as a successful industry application for the Monty knowledge base of Swisscom AG Switzerland. The work which will be discussed here is an improvement, extension and generalization of my master thesis \cite{janchevski_graph_2021}.
