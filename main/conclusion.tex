\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Directions}
\label{chp: conclusion}


As relevant future work in scalable knowledge graph reasoning, we propose attempting the integration of COINs with algorithms for general first-order logical knowledge graph query answering like BetaE~\cite{ren_beta_2020} and obtaining comparisons to baseline models on larger non-standard knowledge graphs.
